Option 1: Run directly with Go
```bash
go run main.go
```
Option 2: Build and run the executable
```bash
go build .
./chat.exe
```
Option 3: Build with custom name
```bash
go build -o goconverge.exe .
./goconverge.exe
```
What you'll see:
The server will start and show:
```
year/month/day XX:XX:XX started server on :8888
```

To test it:
Open another terminal/command prompt
Connect with telnet: telnet localhost 8888
Use commands like:
```bash
/nick <name> - get a name, otherwise user will stay anonymous
/nick yourname
/join general
/msg Hello everyone!
/rooms
/quit
```
- `/nick <name>` - set your nickname; if not set, you will remain anonymous
- `/join <room>` - join a chat room (e.g., `general`)
- `/msg <message>` - send a message to the current room
- `/rooms` - list all available chat rooms
- `/quit` - leave the chat
To run the server, you have three options:
Make sure you have Go installed and your GOPATH set up correctly.
The server runs on port 8888 by default. Make sure no other program is using that port!
